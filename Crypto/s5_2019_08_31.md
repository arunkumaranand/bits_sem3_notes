# Asymmetric 


## prime Numers
any int p which is > 1 is aprime no 
iff its only divisors 1 & P

### Why prime no. important?
- extensively used in assymmetric encr.

### How to check a no. is prime or not?

** Miller-Rabin Algorthm**

1. __n__ is to be tested
2. __(n-1)__ is an even no.
3. also selct __a__ is arandom no __1 < a < (n-1)__


n-1 = m * 2^k
// (23-1) = 11 * 2^1
// n = 23, m =11

T = a^m mod n

### Example: 1
Test 19

(19-1)  = m * 2 ^k
        = 9 * 2 ^1
m = 9
n = 1
let us take a =2
T = 2^9 mod 18 
0th Iteration
T = -1 mod 19 // because 18 = -1 in mod 19
So 19 is prim

### Example 2
Test 21
n-1 = m * 2^k
(21-1)  = m * 2 ^k
        = 5 * 2 ^2
m = 5
n = 2
T = a^m mod n

let us take a =2
T = 2^5 mod 21 = 11

0th Iter
---
T = 11^2 mod 21 = 16

1st Iter
---
T = 16^2 mod 21 = 16
