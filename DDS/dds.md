# Distributed Data Systems

Course no: S1-19_SSZG554
Instructor: Sourish Banerji
Credit: 5 units

## Course Objective

1. Covers the aspects of computing and information access across multiple processing elements connected by any form of communication network, either LAN or WAN.
2. Development of contemporary application that demonstrate their efficacy by connecting millions of users/application/machines across the globe without relying on traditional client-server approach.
3. The general computing trend to leverage shared resources and and massive data over the internet. This course aims to provide an understand of theory and system aspects of distributed data.
